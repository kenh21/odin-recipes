            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p class="strom1">
                    This stromboli recipe uses premade pizza dough. Kids and adults        
                    love this pizza creation. There is usually leftover sauce, so you
                    serve it the next day over hot spaghetti.

            </p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200) degrees C).</li>
                        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat
                            until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and 
                            discard grease. Romve from the heat; stir in pizza sauce,
                            ham, bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms until well combined</li>
                        <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface into a large square;
                            transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Arrange pepperoni over the lower
                            half of the square, then spoon desired amont of sauce over 
                            pepperoni. Sprinkle mozzarella over sauce, then fold top 
                            half of dough down over fillings; pinch the edges
                            together to seal. Poke holes in the dough and brush with
                            melted butter. If you have remaining sauce, reserve it
                            for another use.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 
                            30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cut into four pieces.</li>
